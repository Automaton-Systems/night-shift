### Added
- Root Mode BETA (@notjuliee). BETA means it is not tested on many devices. Make sure you can reboot your phone without looking at the screen, just in case.
- Initial/incomplete support for Android 12 (@AdamNiederer).
- Start/stop times can be set to sunset/sunrise individually
- Settings screen with all non-profile preferences
- Hebrew translation (@Shopimisrel)

### Changed
- All non-filter preferences moved to their own screen
- Revert top switch toggle back to a floating button
- Prevent changing filter preferences until overlay permission is granted

### Fixed
- Time preference summary now displays in proper locale
- Fixed crash when toggling via the tile (@gilbsgilbs and @automaton82)
- Maybe fixed filter sometimes not turning on the very first time after installation

### Removed
- Removed "Sunrise to Sunset" preference, since you can set them individually
- Removed separate Google Play version (which included a prompt to rate the app)
- Removed Red Moon from the Google Play Store
